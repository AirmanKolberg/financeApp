# financeApp
For years I've been looking for the perfect finance app that doesn't exist, and now I believe I can create it.  From Daily Budget, to Mint, to dozens of others, I could never find an app that shows my daily budget, but also keeps my portfolio, balance sheet, and considers our net worth in assembling our budget.  Well, I've put myself to the test to start designing this app.  I will be updating it here on GitHub periodically, but I imagine that I will continue to work on it daily.  Since this app requires that I do a lot of personal things (ie log into my bank account for me to grab information, such as account balances), I will be keeping all sensitive material and functions in "sensitive.py".  I will then go back, revise the sensitive sections, and add comments to help bridge the gaps for when I post the updates.

If, for any reason, you would like to donate- though unneccesary, is always apreciated!

# Update
This app, I've decided, is going to run, to the user, much like Metasploit.  Just a simple framework that can call other apps.  One of which, I'm calling Budget Bug.  It keeps a weekly log of rolling budgets.  Perhaps you limit your weekly spending on food, or cannabis, or even vintage magazines exclusively with primarily yellow covers- this can keep track of what you have left to spend each week, but what you don't spend from the week before rolls over.  Why not?  This could be fun!  [Shaka emoji]

# Update, 15Nov2020
My current goal in the development of this app is to go over everything I've written so far, and slowly move all of the sensitive material into two .py files.  I will keep updating in, what is slowly becoming a blog-style fashion of updates.  Whenever there is a *major update* I will make that title more obvious than just "# Update, 32Nov2020" or what have you.  Thank you for following along with my project(s), if you are at all!  This will be my primary focus, when it comes to Python projects, until further notice.  Whenever this changes, it will be notated within this file.  Cheers, mate(s)!  [Shaka emoji]

# Update, 16Nov2020
The biggest update so far (not that this is very far in, though I digress), I have created a fully functional "change password" feature.  I was also able to update a few other important functions so that all of the main .py pages are personal information-free, and therefore, in my opinion, more functional and useable.  More updates to come, but I'm proud of my progress today, especially considering how much time Nina and I spent together outside today!  It must have been close to about 4hrs so far, and there's evidence we may be outside again momentarily.  Thanks for reading.  Have a good day, all!

#Update, 19Nov2020
For the time being, though I have recently posted a few update, I will be focusing most of my efforts on reworking the main.py framework to be a little more autonomous when it comes to creating/updating user files, as well as adding new functions/features within framework apps, or the framework itself.  This also includes, but is not limited to, a universal "--help" command to show any/all options in the current window, universal "exit", etc.
